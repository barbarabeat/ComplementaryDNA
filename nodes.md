Complementary DNA

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.

If you want to know more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA

In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". Your function receives one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to return the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

Example: (input --> output)

"ATTGC" --> "TAACG"
"GTAT" --> "CATA"


* Before Session 🍅:
    - Choose language: JS ✅
    - Create folders and adjust node, readme and package. ✅

    -----

- Initially we implement the methods (in the test environment), it will fail and then make the implementation in the function for that test to pass. Walk this way until everything is covered. It's good to plan before putting your "hands on";
- When finished, take index.js to the website.
